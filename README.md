#Android QCM
Hello, this repository contains a simple application I made for android exam.
It has the following features:
## LoginActivity
- using default LoginActivity (admin@mail.fr:admin)
- TODO: Link it to database
## QCMActivity
- Using single template fragment to display all questions
- Animated transition between questions 
- Random question each time from a hard coded array of questions
- TODO: Timer for questions timing
## ResultsActivity
- Displaying result in a DonutProgress View

This application uses the following third party libraries:
- com.stepstone.stepper:material-stepper:4.3.1 (https://github.com/stepstone-tech/android-material-stepper)
- com.github.lzyzsd:circleprogress:1.2.1 (https://github.com/lzyzsd/CircleProgress)
